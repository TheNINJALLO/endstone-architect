## Overview

Tag-gated and team-based architect build zones for Minecraft Bedrock. This release is aligned with Endstone 0.11.8 and Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server 1.26.40, and is distributed as a Python wheel for direct installation in an Endstone server.

## Capabilities

- Tag-gated and team-aware construction zones
- Persistent area and session records
- Administrative visibility for controlled building workflows

## Compatibility

| Component | Supported version |
|---|---|
| Endstone | `0.11.8` |
| Endstone API | `0.11` |
| Bedrock Dedicated Server | `1.26.40` |
| Python | `>=3.10` |
| Plugin release | `v1.0.16` |

## Install

Download the wheel from the matching GitHub release:

```bash
gh release download v1.0.16 --repo TheNINJALLO/endstone-architect --pattern "*.whl"
```

Copy the downloaded wheel into the server's `plugins/` directory, remove any older wheel for the same plugin, and restart Endstone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use Endstone `0.11.8` with BDS `1.26.40`. Back up worlds and plugin data before upgrading a production server.

## Configuration and secrets

Runtime databases, logs, local `.env` files, server directories, and root `config.toml` files are excluded from source releases. When an example configuration is provided, copy it locally and keep live tokens, passwords, webhook URLs, and server identifiers out of Git.

## Release automation

Every `v*` tag runs [the wheel release workflow](.github/workflows/wheel-release.yml), builds the package in a clean GitHub runner, stores the wheel as a workflow artifact, and attaches it to the matching GitHub release.
